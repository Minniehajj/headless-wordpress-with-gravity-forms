https://developers.wpengine.com/blog/gravity-forms-in-headless-wordpress/

This repo provides a suite of React components, a React hook, and helper functions that you can even drop into your own projects and have Gravity Forms “just work”. They'll handle rendering out Gravity Forms forms and sending form submissions to your headless WordPress backend.
